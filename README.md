## Prerequisites

- **SQL Server / SQL Server Express:** Ensure it is installed on your machine.
- **Visual Studio Code:** Download from [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
- **mssql VS Code Extension:** Install via the [mssql extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-mssql.mssql).

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/cvijovics/CMPT391S2025.git

2. **Open in VS Code**

   Open the cloned folder in Visual Studio Code.

3. **Connect to SQL Server**

   - Press **F1** to open the Command Palette.
   - Type `MS SQL: Connect` and press Enter.
   - Enter your connection details:
     - **Server:** `localhost` or `localhost\SQLEXPRESS` (depending on your installation)
     - **Authentication:** Choose Windows Authentication (or SQL Server Authentication if needed)
     - **Database:** For initial setup, connect to the `master` database.

4. **Create the Database**

   - Open the `table creation script.sql` (or `DBCreation.sql`) file.
   - Ensure the file is active (click inside the editor) before running the commands.
   - Execute the following commands to create your database and switch to it:
     
     ```sql
     IF NOT EXISTS (SELECT * FROM sys.databases WHERE name = 'CMPT391S2025')
     BEGIN
         CREATE DATABASE CMPT391S2025;
     END;
     USE CMPT391S2025;
     ```
     
   - **Note:** If batch separators (like `GO`) cause issues, run each command individually.

5. **Insert Sample Data**

   - Execute the provided insert scripts (e.g., `student insert.sql`, `department insert.sql`) to populate the tables with sample data.

6. **Test Your Setup**

   - Create a new SQL file (for example, `test.sql`) and run:
     
     ```sql
     SELECT student_id, first_name, last_name FROM student;
     SELECT department_id, department_name FROM department;
     ```
     
   - You should see query results with headers and the inserted data.

## Troubleshooting

- **Active SQL Editor:**  
  Ensure the SQL file you're executing is in focus (click inside the editor) before running commands.

- **Output Panel:**  
  Open **View > Output** in VS Code and select the "MSSQL" channel for error messages and logs.

- **Reload VS Code:**  
  If problems persist, try reloading VS Code with `Developer: Reload Window` from the Command Palette.

## Next Steps

- Expand your SQL queries to include operations such as joins, filtering, and more.
- Integrate these SQL scripts with your application as needed.
- Update the schema and scripts as project requirements evolve.

Happy coding!
